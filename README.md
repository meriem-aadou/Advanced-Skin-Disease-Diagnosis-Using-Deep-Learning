# Advanced-Skin-Disease-Diagnosis-Using-Deep-Learning

This project presents a multimodal, multiclass skin disease classification system developed using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The approach integrates Focal Loss, Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss, data augmentation, transfer learning, and fine-tuning to improve diagnostic performance across diverse skin conditions.
